The program should ask the user for the number of kilometers 
they want to travel and the age of the passenger.

Based on this we should calculate the price according these rules:
1. The ticket price is defined based on the km (0.21 â‚¬ per km)
2. A 20% discount must be applied for minors
3. A 40% discount must be applied for people over 65.

*
- The output of the final price should be presented with a maximum of two decimal places.

Bonus
- Print the final price on the page instead of in the console
- Additionally, display other information on the page, 
such as the price before the discount and the age and km specified by the user
- Use CSS for appearance.
